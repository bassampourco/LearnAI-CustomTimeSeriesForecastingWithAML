# Welcome

Welcome to the workshop on using the Microsoft Azure ML Forecasting Toolkit.

In this one-day hands-on workshop, we learn how to use the Azure ML Python Forecasting library to load and pre-process time series data, train and compare multiple time series models, and deploy a forecasting solution using Azure Machine Learning.

# Pre-requisites

The two pre-requisites for the workshop are Python proficiency and familiarity with Azure Machine Learning for end-to-end deployments. 

 - We will be using Python for data science, and in particular the `pandas` and `scikit-learn` packages.
 - We will use Azure Machine Learning (and its Python SDK) and its architecture for model deployment and operationalization. The [LearnAI Bootcamp](https://azure.github.io/LearnAI-Bootcamp/proaidev_bootcamp) series is a great resource for learning about Azure ML.

# Goals

*Azure ML Package for Forecasting*

- Ingest a time series data and run various summaries to explore and understand its shortcomings
- Learn about different options for imputing missing values for times series data
- How to do feature engineering in the context of times series data
- How to train multiple time series models and compare their performance
- How to deploy trained models using Python's Azure Machine Learning API
