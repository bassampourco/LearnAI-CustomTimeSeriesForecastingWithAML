# Welcome

Welcome to the workshop on using the Microsoft Azure ML Forecasting Toolkit.

In this one-day hands-on workshop, we learn how to use the Azure ML Python Forecasting library to load and pre-process time series data, train and compare multiple time series models, and deploy a forecasting solution using Azure Machine Learning.

# Pre-requisites

The two pre-requisites for the workshop are Python proficiency and familiarity with Azure Machine Learning for end-to-end deployments. Workshop participants will need to be familiar with using Python for data science, and in particular the `pandas` and `scikit-learn` packages. The labs also assume an intermediate knowledge of Azure Machine Learning and its architecture for model deployment and operatinalition, as well as the necessary subscription and resources to use Azure Machine Learning. The [LearnAI Bootcamp](https://azure.github.io/LearnAI-Bootcamp/proaidev_bootcamp) series is a great resource for learning about Azure ML.

# Goals

*Azure ML Package for Forecasting*

- Ingest a time series data and run various summaries to understand its shortcomings
- Different options for imputing missing values for times series data
- Feature engineering for times series data
- Train multiple time series models and compare their performance
- Deploy trained models using Python's Azure Machine Learning API
